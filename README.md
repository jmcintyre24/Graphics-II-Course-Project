# Graphics-II-Course-Project
Graphics II Project Repository

## Overview
This is a DirectX11 rendering API created for Project & Portfolio IV using Gateware libraries. (Which are written & Maintained @ Full Sail University, License's in project.) (*Graphics-II*).  
CMake(**VER.** *3.16+*) is required to build the project.

***MAIN*** is the newest project itself.  
***BACKUP*** is an older version that could be potentially broken and will most likely be deleted soon. 

## Controls:
- **Holding right click, move mouse** around to look around.
- **C** travels downwards.
- **Space** travels upwards.
- **WASD** for general strafing/movement.
- **Q & E** for rotating the camera quickly left or right.
- **Z** toggles the ability to move the directional light.
- **Holding left click (AFTER PRESSING Z), dragging** moves the directional light horizontally.

## Features (WIP):
- [x] FPS fly-through style camera
- [x] Complex Mesh Loading
- [x] Textures on Complex Mesh
- [x] Directional Lighting on Complex Mesh
- [x] Point Light on Complex Mesh (With Range Attenuation)
- [x] Two Different Functional Lights on the same drawn geometry. (Point Light & Directional Lighting)
- [x] Dynamic Change in direction of directional light & dynamic Change in position of positional light.
- [x] Normal Mapping on a full 3D complex mesh.
- [x] Unique Pixel Shader using relative position, time, and a wave. (Sin) Causes whatever mesh/object that is using that pixel shader to pulse and change colors based on the X, Y, and time.
